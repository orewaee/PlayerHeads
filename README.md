Players heads drop after death


## Important

At the moment the plugin is at the development stage.
That is why the logic of its work may change in the process of finalization.
If you have errors, please contact [issues](https://github.com/orewaee/PlayerHeads/issues) for help.


## Commands

- `/playerheads get` - get one head of his own
- `/playerheads get [name]` - get one head of a player with a certain name
- `/playerheads get [name] [n]` - get [n] goals of a player with a certain name


## TODO

- [ ] Add SkinsRestorer API support
- [ ] Add a custom TOML config
- [ ] Add support for all cores
- [x] Add a command to get the player's head
